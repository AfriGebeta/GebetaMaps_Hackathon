# Go Find Taxi 🚕

A Flutter-based mobile application designed to help Ethiopian commuters easily locate and navigate traditional bus taxi routes.

## Problem Statement 🎯

In Ethiopia, affordable public transportation options, such as traditional bus taxis, play a vital role in daily commuting. However, locating these taxis, particularly for less familiar routes, can be challenging due to:

- Lack of centralized information
- No real-time updates on taxi locations
- Difficulty finding correct pick-up points
- Limited knowledge of routes for unfamiliar destinations
- Time wasted waiting at incorrect stops

GoFindTaxi seeks to address these issues by offering a user-friendly platform that enables commuters to locate traditional bus taxis in real-time, access detailed information about popular routes, and receive personalized recommendations.
